# How to Update Your Local Machine with Exact UI Design

## Quick Update Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Updated File
From your Replit project, download the file: `UPDATED_HOME_SCREEN.tsx`

### Step 2: Replace Your Local File
On your local machine, navigate to your project:

```bash
cd ai-success-coach/AISuccessCoach/app/(tabs)/
```

Replace the `index.tsx` file with the content from `UPDATED_HOME_SCREEN.tsx`

Or simply copy-paste the entire content of `UPDATED_HOME_SCREEN.tsx` into your local `index.tsx` file.

### Step 3: Start Metro Bundler
```bash
cd ai-success-coach/AISuccessCoach
npx expo start --clear
```
